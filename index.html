                    <p>Welcome to my portfolio! First, a little bit about my past: I grew up near Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. 
                        Iâ€™ve always had a passion for games, whether it be video games, analog, or physical.
                        In middle school I joined the Boy Scouts of America and earned the rank of Eagle Scout. 
                        This helped give me valuable experience in communication, leadership, and collaborative work.
                        During High school my interest in video games led to me enroll in multiple computer programming courses, where I hoped I would 
                        learn the tools to make games of my own. I learned to code in Java and found that I enjoyed algorithms and problem-solving.
                        My enjoyment of computer science and my passion for games led me to Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) 
                        where I would major in Game Design & Development. Through the co-op program at RIT, I was able to get a position at 
                        PARGovernment, which has since been acquired by Booz Allen Hamilton where I work now as a Software Developer.</p>
                    <!-- <br /> -->
                    <p>My passion for games is still strong, and I am currently searching for a position more suited towards my interests. 
                        I have many personal projects that I am currently working on whose progress can be viewed through 
                        the tabs at the top of the page. I have other past projects, both school and personal, but I have decided 
                        to keep this website updated with the most current and relevant projects. I hope you find these endeavors 
                        interesting and explore all I have done and learned.</p>
