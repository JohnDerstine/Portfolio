                    <h2>Booz Allen Hamilton</h2>
                    <p>Through RIT's career fair I was able to meet with a hiring representative from PARGovernment and was offered a position there for a summer co-op. 
                        After the co-op ended, I was offered the opportunity to work part-time over the semester and decided to continue full time for my second co-op. 
                        During this second co-op PARGovernment was acquired by Booz Allen Hamilton, where I now reside. For both companies I worked as a Software Developer.
                        My main responsibility is completing tickets that were either submitted by clients, users, or the test team to fix, improve, or add features to the software.
                        The specific project I was involved with is WinTAK. This is a government contracted project, so I can't go into much detail of the software itself or the
                        specific features I worked on, but the list of skills that I used and learned are as follows:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>C# Development</li>
                        <li>XAML</li>
                        <li>AGILE Development methodologies</li>
                        <li>Automated testing</li>
                        <li>Debugging and Testing</li>
                        <li>Jira</li>
                        <li>Git</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>While the role wasn't game design related, I am extremely grateful for the opportunity to work at PARGovernment/Booz Allen Hamilton and improve my
                        software development skills. One of the biggest things I have learned in this position is the importance of peer-reviewing code. With a program as complex 
                        as WinTAK, there are so many moving parts, some of which I didn't even know existed. All of this creates many scenarios where changing a feature can unintentionally
                        effect another feature. Peer-review is incredibly useful for catching these before code is pushed and prevents the issue from having to be revisted later.
